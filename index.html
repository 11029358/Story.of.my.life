<p>19-08-1990: Journey Starts
I was born as a happy fat kid, not much has changed though I’m not fat anymore. 

From the start on I was a very active child, thereby I was also very motivated to study and working hard. Though did didn’t always lead to the desired outcomes, as I was never the smart-guy. Part of this can be explained that I had dyslexia and had trouble reading, which consumed a lot of my time practicing to keep growing with the class. 

My grades where never bad, I was actually really proud of them, especially the ones for presenting which something I love to do, and invested a lot of time in as well. However the Cito-toets the final exam after graduation school was not something I was good at. This was mainly focusing on comprehensive reading, analytical reasoning, math, and general knowledge. The comprehensive reading was a pain in the ass for me, as this decreased my score significantly ending with a score of 529. This means that your good for BBL/KBL, however as my grades besides the tests where pretty 7+ and all my friends where going TL/Havo or VWO, I convinced both my parents and teachers to go to TL/HAVO as well. 

This is a class which let your experience both levels, and based on how you perform you will get devoted to a class after the first year (TL or HAVO). Although my grades where rather good again 7+ my mentor convinced my parents that it was best to start at TL and maybe later go to HAVO. This was really hard for me, but I had no choice so I followed their advice. 

After having a rather tough time, because I was quite disappointed by leaving my friends behind, and felt downgraded I found my motivation again. During this period I gained a lot of weight and lost some self-confidence, as I quit sports all together and just cycled to school. 
The turning point came actually when one of my (still) best friends joined our class. We where from the beginning onwards very good friends as we both lived far from the school cycled together and played all kind of games in clans. We also started to play sports again, and motivated each other in all kind of ways. 

A year later we had an open-day at the MBO (school you go after you graduate VMBO). First of all I didn’t feel at home at all at this school, and I wanted something more than MBO as I knew I could do better if I just get the opportunity. 
This was the moment where the real motivation came alive. I started doing Math course via LOI on the side such that I could graduate for TL+ and continue to HAVO. In the end I passed all my exams and Math (which I wasn’t allowed to do at school as I was not good enough) was my highest grade with an 8 as average. 

This opened my doors to the HAVO, which I did at a institution where you have the possibility to combine 2 years in 1. This was a tough experience but I graduated in 1 year, and with good grades too. 
The next step was HBO, as I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do but I knew I wanted something business related I asked my mom and especially my dad for advice, and ended up with a study called managerial economics and some other fancy term. However did didn’t last long as I suffered from one of the most annoying pains I had ever had (worse than ear pain!) which lasted couple months, and therefore I missed all the exams and deadlines. The good thing was I could quit before February that doesn’t give you the official penalty. 

Once I completely recovered and got back to my routine again I started working at the Green Grocery, where I assisted in selling vegetables part-time and kept orientating myself for studies. I also signed up for the her-orientatejaar of the HVA (University of Applied Science Amsterdam). This because I had hard times figuring out what my passion in work life was. I knew what I like, but as this is so broad and in some many areas it was super hard for me the find a good fit for a study. 
After the course I (thought) knew what I wanted to do, and started the HBO study Sport & Bewegen, with a side specialization in management and psychology. This because it was a very active study, much practice rather than just theory without applying it, and rather broad though all related to sports. 
This study year was the most fun, and diverse I had ever done. We taught kids how to do Acro-gym, we gave swimming classed to elderly and we made personal training programs for office workers. Besides learning to cooperate with your fellow classmates I also learned a lot how to treat and deal with different people, what way of communication they prefer, and how you should approach them. After my first year in which I learned a lot I entered my second year, where I felt the steep learning curve was decreasing significantly, and I lost the challenge. In addition we also had to start looking for internships and I had no clue at all of what I wanted to do. At the same time my brother just made a upgrade from HBO to University, and told me enthusiastically about the benefits, and informed me that I could do the same, as I had my propedeuse. 

However in order to join the university for the studies of my desire (psychology or Economics by than) you needed Math on VWO level. Which I than rushed in half a year after having no math for 2.5 years because time for signing up running out and passed the exam and course with a 7+. 

How I came to economics was due to the fact that my brother did this, and that I wanted something broad which would learn me a lot and keep my doors open. Thereby I was able to include a Minor that I did in psychology to focus on behavioral economics. 

University was a real challenge for me, the way of studying was completely different than at HBO. Not only did we changed from classes every semester, I also had only 8hours of lectures a day, and the rest I spent in the library or the gym. This because the amount of literature and the lack of my VWO background was a huge lag for me. However because I was motivated and I wanted to prove myself that I could do university I worked hard, and failed my first exams. This was a punch in my self confidence, as I gave it my all, stopped my HBO and had to pass university else I would had to work without a proper degree. After asking some help here and there I learned just in time how to absorb the huge amounts of information, and how to deal with it. And I thus passed all the courses the year and got my propedeuse within 1 year which was really challenging for me. This year I was mainly reading studying and working out as a distraction, not so much of the university outgoing crazy life for me. 

In the third year when the feeling of WOW I made it to UNIVERSITY already decreased, and the feeling of  “it’s not so special actually” took over something amazing happened. I had to opportunity to go on an exchange, however you needed a good GPA/Grades, and because I wasn’t gifted that all came easy my grades weren’t super high. Luckily the way to get in the exchange universities was a combination of grades, motivation letter, and description of why this is good for me. The latter two, and than mainly the motivation letter made that I was able to go on exchange to Singapore. 

This was the best time of my life. Not only because we were super lucky with our apartment 7 guys living together in an amazing flat with a view on the marina bay sands, but also because all the traveling I was able to do there, and experience a completely different culture from so close.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
